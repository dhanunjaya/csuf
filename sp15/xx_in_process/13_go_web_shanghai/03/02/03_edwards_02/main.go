We were able to do this because ServeMux also has a ServeHTTP method,
meaning that it too satisfies the Handler interface.

For me it simplifies things to think of a ServeMux as just being a special kind of handler,
which instead of providing a response itself passes the request on to a second handler.

This isn't as much of a leap as it first sounds â€“
chaining handlers together is fairly commonplace in Go.

Processing HTTP requests with Go is primarily about two things:
(1) ServeMux aka Request Router aka MultiPlexor
(2) Handlers
