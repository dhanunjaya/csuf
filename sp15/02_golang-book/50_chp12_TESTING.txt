Programming is not easy; even the best programmers are incapable of writing
programs that work exactly as intended every time. Therefore an important part
of the software development process is testing. Writing tests for our code is a
good way to ensure quality and improve reliability.

Tests are identified by starting a function with the word Test and taking
one argument of type *testing.T
