“There are all kinds of silences and each of them means a different thing.
There is the silence that comes with morning in a forest, and this is different
from the silence of a sleeping city. There is silence after a rainstorm, and
before a rainstorm, and these are not the same. There is the silence of
emptiness, the silence of fear, the silence of doubt. There is a certain
silence that can emanate from a lifeless object as from a chair lately used,
or from a piano with old dust upon its keys, or from anything that has answered
to the need of a man, for pleasure or for work. This kind of silence can speak.
Its voice may be melancholy, but it is not always so; for the chair may have
been left by a laughing child or the last notes of the piano may have been
raucous and gay. Whatever the mood or the circumstance, the essence of its
quality may linger in the silence that follows. It is a soundless echo.”
― Beryl Markham, West with the Night
