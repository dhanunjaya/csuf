Documentation

Go has the ability to automatically generate documentation for packages
in a similar way to the standard package documentation.

In a terminal run this command:
godoc your/path/math Average

godoc github.com/goestoeleven/golang-book/PACKAGES/math Average

You should see information displayed for the function we just wrote.
We can improve this documentation by adding a comment before the function:

// Finds the average of a series of numbers
func Average(xs []float64) float64 {

If you run go install in the math folder, then re-run the godoc command
you should see our comment below the function definition.

This documentation is also available in web form by running this command:

godoc -http=":6060"
and entering this URL into your browser:

http://localhost:6060/pkg/

You should be able to browse through all of the packages installed on your system.
